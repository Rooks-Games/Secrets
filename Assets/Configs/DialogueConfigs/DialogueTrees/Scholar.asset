    DialogueText: "Ah, so you\u2019ve been poking around, have you? Look, the world
      isn\u2019t as black-and-white as you might think. The knowledge I\u2019ve shared
      has helped people far beyond this town, even if it\u2019s caused a few\u2026
      complications here. You\u2019ve uncovered my secret, so let\u2019s make a deal:
      You keep this quiet, and I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ve got my full support
      when you need it."

      only share information about the town\u2019s history and the curiosities I\u2019ve
      studied. If you\u2019ve been hearing rumors, I suggest you stop entertaining
      them. I\u2019m here to help, not harm."

      and initiative would be a mistake. My vote is for you  to stay. They\u2019ve
      done nothing to be scrutinized, I\u2019ll be on your side during the meeting."

    DialogueText: Curiosity is a fine trait, but when paired with unfounded accusations,
      it becomes dangerous. I cannot support someone so reckless. I believe you should
      leave this town and its people alone.

      how quiet this place is. Still, knowledge is abundant here for those who seek
      it. I\u2019m more than happy to share what I know\u2014though some mysteries
      are best left undisturbed. Feel free to visit me if you have questions about
      our town\u2019s history."
