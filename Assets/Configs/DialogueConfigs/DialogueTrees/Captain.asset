      it out. Fine. I made a mistake\u2014a terrible mistake\u2014and I\u2019ve been
      trying to make up for it every day since. I wasn\u2019t strong enough back
      then, but I\u2019ve worked hard to ensure nothing like that ever happens again.
      Please\u2026 keep this to yourself. The town needs to believe in me, or we\u2019ll
      all fall apart."
