      that isn\u2019t in the best interest of this town. Fine, yes, maybe I\u2019ve
      set aside a little for... contingencies. Do you know how hard it is to keep
      this place afloat? If I didn\u2019t plan ahead, this town would collapse. You
      keep quiet about this, and I\u2019ll make sure no one questions your place
      here."
