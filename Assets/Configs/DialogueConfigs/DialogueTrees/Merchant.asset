      I bring in is strictly above board, but do you know how much this town relies
      on trade? Some of these \u2018illegal\u2019 goods have saved lives and kept
      the town running. If you keep this between us, I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re
      well taken care of. Nobody needs to know."

      fair and square. Do you have any idea how hard I work to keep this town supplied?
      Instead of throwing wild accusations, maybe you should ask yourself who\u2019s
      spreading these lies about me."

      here. Rare, exotic, and just what you need\u2014even if you didn\u2019t know

      just the thing to brighten your day or solve your problems."
