    DialogueText: "Alright, listen here. Farming\u2019s a cutthroat business, whether
      you believe it or not. I didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019 that wasn\u2019t necessary
      to keep my fields alive and my family fed. What\u2019s a few wilted crops or
      stolen produce compared to a whole town going hungry? You keep your mouth shut
      about this, and I\u2019ll make sure to have your back when the time comes."

      ain\u2019t just about planting seeds\u2014it\u2019s about reading the land,
      feeling the seasons. Been doing it my whole life, and it\u2019s hard work,
      but there\u2019s no better reward than seeing the harvest come in. Say, if
      you ever need a fresh apple or some advice on growing your own, you come see
      me, alright?"
